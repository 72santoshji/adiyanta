    <h2>Before the Fire — the Chit Became Witness</h2>

    <p>The fire was lit.<br>Not violent.<br>Not calm.<br>Simply burning.</p>

    <p>
        Flames rose upward — slow, steady,<br>
        as if time itself had forgotten how to move.
    </p>

    <p>
        Smoke drifted toward the sky,<br>
        but within me something else was gathering weight.
    </p>

    <p>
        This was a cremation.<br>
        Yet it did not feel like an ending.<br>
        It felt like the dissolution of form.
    </p>

    <p>
        People stood around.<br>
        Words were spoken.<br>
        Rituals continued.
    </p>

    <p>
        But for me,<br>
        everything was slowly dissolving into silence.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Swāhā.</em><br>
        Each time the word fell into the fire,<br>
        something else fell with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        A name.<br>
        A shape.<br>
        An identity.<br>
        What had been called “I.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The fire accepted everything.<br>
        Without question.<br>
        Without resistance.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was not listening to chants.<br>
        I was not watching ceremony.<br>
        I was watching how everything returns.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wood was being offered to the fire.<br>
        Form was changing.<br>
        Existence was not.
    </p>

    <p>
        In that moment,<br>
        my chit became a witness.<br>
        Not a thinker.<br>
        Not a judge.<br>
        Only a seer.
    </p>

    <p>
        And without words,<br>
        the first movement arose.<br>
        Not a question.<br>
        Not curiosity.<br>
        A remembering.
    </p>

    <p>
        As if something ancient within me had awakened.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fire was burning.<br>
        Yet it was not burning itself.<br>
        It was a medium.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wood transformed —<br>
        into smoke,<br>
        into ash,<br>
        into air.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the fire…<br>
        remained only the cause.
    </p>

    <p>
        The chit did not give an answer.<br>
        It gave a direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>“यत् सर्वं भवति, पर स्वयं न भवति।”</strong><br>
        <em>(That because of which everything happens, yet which itself does not happen.)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        My eyes were on the fire.<br>
        But my awareness had shifted elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is false burns and disappears.<br>
        What is true remains unseen,<br>
        untouched,<br>
        even while burning.
    </p>

    <p>
        I stayed seated.<br>
        No conclusion.<br>
        No doctrine.<br>
        Only fire. Chit. Silence.
    </p>

    <p>
        I did not search for answers.<br>
        I did not seek belief.<br>
        I did not seek comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
        I asked myself ten questions.<br>
        Not aloud.<br>
        Not in sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
        They did not demand answers.<br>
        They demanded honesty.
    </p>

    <p>
        This book is not the answers to those questions.<br>
        It is the path they opened.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is where Adiyanta begins.
